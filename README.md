## Keep These Tips in Mind While Learning Programming
```
1. Learn and code every day, consistency is important.
2. Write it down - plan your code before you start coding and understand the input to your program and the output from your code.
3. Learn to debug your code - look at the code line by line to see how it works.
4. Surround yourself with other people who are learning. Teach each other.
5. Learn taking notes.
6. Build something, anything. For example, simple calculator, or program to save and read data from TXT files.
7. Focus on 1 thing! Take small steps, but every day, consistency is very important again.
8. Learn to ask GOOD questions to others:
  - G: Give context on what you are trying to do, clearly describing the problem.
  - O: Outline the things you have already tried to fix the issue.
  - O: Offer your best guess as to what the problem might be. It helps the person who is helping you not only know what you're thinking, but also know that you've thought of something yourself.
  - D: Demonstrate what's going on. Include the code, the tracing error message, and an explanation of the steps you followed that resulted in the error. That way, the person helping doesn't have to try to recreate the problem.
